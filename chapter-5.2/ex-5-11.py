# Programming Exercise 5-11
#
# Program to quiz a user with a random addition problem.
# This program uses a random function to generate addends for an addition problem,
#   calls a function to display the problem, passing the operands as arguments,
#   calls a second function to prompt the user for an answer to the problem,
# it calculates the correct answer,
# then passes the user answer and correct answer to a third function to evaluate the results,
#   and display whether the user was correct or not.



# to generate random numbers, import random module
import random


# define the main function
def main():
        # Define constant values for min addend and max addend

    # Define local int variables for addend 1, addend 2, user answer and correct answer

    user_answer = 0
    correct_answer = 0

    # Generate random integers for addend 1 and addend 2, with values from min to max
    # constants defined above

    display_problem(addend_one, addend_two)
    # Assign the user answer to the result of calling the function to prompt for answer
    user_answer = prompt_for_answer()
    # Calculate correct answer
    correct_answer = calculate_correct_answer(addend_one, addend_two)

# It prompts the user for an answer and casts it to an int,
# then returns the integer value

# This function takes correct answer and user answer as parameters
# if compares them to see if they match
# and displays a success or failure message to the user
